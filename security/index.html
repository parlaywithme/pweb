    We do our best to keep your funds and data secure, and we are very thorough and paranoid in our efforts. We store your bitcoin with our partner Coinbase, whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/security">security practices</a> are the best in the business.
  </div>

  <h3>
    Here are some of the things we do:
  </h3>
  
  <ul class="-basic">
    <li>
      Reward independent security researchers for discovering and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities in our software: see <a href="https://hackerone.com/parlay/">our HackerOne profile</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continuous security patching.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continuous security monitoring from <a href="https://detectify.com/">Detectify</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continuous database balance sanity checks. We will not be another MtGox.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider comprimised any machine that has been used for web browsing or has run Adobe or Microsoft software.
    </li>
    <li>
      Access production environment and sensitive 3rd-party services from uncompromised computers with 2FA.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use gratuitously strong random cycling passwords and 2FA with sensitive 3rd-party services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cycle API keys.
    </li>
    <li>
      Force HTTPS connections to our server in order to secure your data over the wire.
    </li>
    <li>
      Client-side password hashing with bcrypt: our servers never see your password.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sanitize all user-provided data before putting it in the DOM (XSS).
    </li>
    <li>
      Use localStorage instead of session cookies (CSRF).
    </li>
    <li>
      Use X-Frame-Options headers and content security policy directives.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meteor methods with thoroughly checked arguments and user authority in lieu of complex allow/deny rules.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We will hire a skilled security firm to do an in-depth pentest once we can afford to do so.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have also audited our source code for the following types of vulnerabilities:
  </p>

  <ul class="-basic">
    <li>
      Parameter manipulation
    </li>
    <li>
      Replay attacks
    </li>
    <li>
      TOCTOU and race conditions
    </li>
    <li>
      Number processing, including conversion, rounding, and overflows
    </li>
    <li>
      Private data exposure
    </li>
    <li>
      MongoDB injection
    </li>
  </ul>
