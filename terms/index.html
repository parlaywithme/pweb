  We know Terms of Service docs can be long <img class="emoji" src="//e.parlay.io/sleeping.png" title=":sleeping:" alt=":sleeping:" align="absmiddle"> and confusing <img class="emoji" src="//e.parlay.io/confused.png" title=":confused:" alt=":confused:" align="absmiddle">, so we made these notes for some of the most important takeaways.

  <li>
    <h3>
      Your Acceptance
    </h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Terms of Service for the Parlay application and the parlaywith.me website. This is an agreement (“Agreement”) between Parlay Technology Inc.  (“Parlay Inc"), the owner and operator of parlaywith.me (“Site”), any Parlay Inc products or services including  but not limited to our mobile application ( collectively the “Platform”) and you (“you”, “your” or “user(s)”), a user of the Site and Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this Agreement, the words “Parlay Inc,”  “us,”  “we,” and “our,” refer to our company, Parlay Technology Inc. and our Site or Platform, as is appropriate in the context of the use of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      By tapping or clicking “I have read, understand, and agree to all Terms and Conditions”, registering for our Site, or using our Site or Platform, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and the Privacy Policy.  We may amend our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy and may notify you when we do so. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION PROVISIONS THAT MAY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not agree to the Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy please cease using our Site and Platform immediately.  Users of our Platform must be 13 years of age or older.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is between you and Parlay Inc, not with any third party (including, but not limited to, Apple®, Google®, any mobile carrier, or any Participating Merchant (as defined below)), and that Parlay Inc is solely responsible for the Platform. Your use of the Platform may be subject to separate agreements you may enter into with your mobile device operating system provider (e.g., Apple, Google or Microsoft®), your mobile device manufacturer (e.g., Apple, Samsung®), your mobile service carrier (e.g., AT&T® or Verizon®), and other parties involved in providing your mobile device service. Participating Merchants as defined below, third party operating system providers such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, your phone or other mobile device manufacturer, your wireless carrier or other network provider, any other product or service provider related to your mobile device service are collectively referred to as "Covered Third Parties." You agree to comply with all applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Platform. Parlay Inc is not a party to those agreements and has no responsibility for the products and services provided by third parties.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>
      Description of Site and Platform
    </h3>
    The Platform allows users to create parlays (“Parlays”) with friends.  All Parlays created via the Platform are non-binding in nature and are <em class="-bold">NOT</em> to be confused with wagering, gambling, or betting. The Parlays merely allow users to compete with friends and track each other’s Parlay success and failure.  Before, during or after a Parlay users may, at their option, transfer other users Gifts (defined below) at their discretion. Parlays are not agreements, understandings or contracts and do not bind any users to the outcome of the Parlay. Parlays are not guaranteed and may be cancelled at any time by any users.  Parlays do not obligate any users to send Gifts to other users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>
      Parlay Inc’s Role
    </h3>
    Parlay Inc merely provides the Platform for users to interact and create Parlays.  Parlay Inc does not endorse or recommend any users and does not take or handle any Parlays.  Parlay Inc does not guarantee the correctness of a Parlay and does not judge the outcome of any Parlays.   Parlays are solely between users and Parlay Inc is not a party to any Parlays and cannot mediate any disputes between users.   The Platform is not an online gambling website or app and does not take bets, pay out bets, issue odds or side bets of any sort.  YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR AND CANNOT ACCEPT ANY LIABILITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOUR USE OF PARLAY INC OR ANY DISPUTE YOU MAY HAVE WITH ANOTHER USER.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>
      Third Party Operating System Providers, Phone Manufacturers, and Wireless Carriers
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Platform works on an application linked to a particular device and operating system, such as Apple's iOS operating system. Parlay Inc is solely responsible for providing maintenance and support services for the Service. Covered Third Parties have no obligation to provide maintenance or support services for the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covered Third Parties have no warranty obligations whatsoever with respect to the Platform and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Platform to conform to any warranty provided by Parlay Inc, if any, will be Parlay Inc's sole responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>

      Parlay Inc, not any Covered Third Parties, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and (iv) intellectual property claims. Please see the Contact Us section below for how to contact Parlay Inc.
    </p>
    <p>

      If you are using the Platform on an Apple device, you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary. Such rights may also accrue to other handset manufacturers and operating systems which participate in the Platform.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>
      Giving Gifts
    </h3>
    Through the Platform, users may be able to send gifts (“Gifts”) during, before, or after the completion of any Parlay.  Users have the discretion to give Gifts to other users at any time.   Users are not contractually obligated to give any Gifts after the completion of a Parlay.  You agree that Gifts made via the Platform are 100% discretionary and are donative in nature. As Gifts are discretionary, you agree that no users are contractually bound to send you a Gift during your use of the Platform.  Parlay Inc may also offer services that assist users in transferring Gifts to one another.  Such Gifts may be made to other users or to charities of the user’s choice. As Parlays are non-binding, these Gifts are not connected to or related to any Parlays made or listed by users.  Failure to give a gift after a Parlay does not disqualify a user from using the Platform.  Users are never required to give Gifts via the Platform or otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>
      Parlays
    </h3>
    You agree that all Parlays are non-binding in nature and do not constitute a contract between users.  When a Parlay is made by a user no consideration is exchanged between the users.  Any Gifts listed in any Parlays are merely indications that participating users may wish to give you a non-contractual Gift at the end of the Parlay.  You agree that you shall not knowingly or negligently enter into contracts with other users through the Platform.  You agree that no implied contracts are created during your use of the Platform.   You agree that you will not modify a Parlay to create a binding contract during your use of the Platform. You agree to waive any claims or defenses of promissory estoppel, substantial performance, or reliance related to any dispute proceedings regarding any Parlays with other users. You agree to not create or participate in Parlays about sports or commodities.
  </li>

We may conduct such modifications to our Platform for security reasons, intellectual property, legal reasons, or various other reasons at our discretion, and we are not required to explain such modifications.  For example, we may provide updates to fix security flaws, or to respond to legal demands.  Please note that this is a non-binding illustration of how we might exercise our rights under this section, and nothing in this section obligates us to take measures to update the Platform for security, legal or other purposes.
