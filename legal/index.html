<h2>Parlays</h2>
<p>
  Parlays are predictions: when you send a new parlay to someone, you are saying, "I think X will happen, and I might give you Y if I'm wrong." When the receiver taps the "Parlay" button, they are saying, "I think you're wrong, and I might give you Y if X doesn't happen."
</p>
<p>
  Parlays are not agreements, understandings, or contracts. The Parlay app cannot be used for betting or gambling. There is no guarantee that parlays will not be canceled by a participant, that outcomes will be judged fairly, or that gifts will be given.
